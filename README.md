# PartyWall_mobile


Project Setup

Before start setting up the PartyWall_mobile application please follow the PartyWall (backend) setup instruction 

Install expo-cli if it doesn't exist. "npm install --global expo-cli"

Run "npm run relay" to generate code to represent our queries and mutations.

Run "expo start" and select "run on ios simulator" in the appearing browser.

(There is no specific configuration for ios, so I expect that the application can work on Android properly,
but I am not sure because I couldn't test it on both the phone and the emulator).
